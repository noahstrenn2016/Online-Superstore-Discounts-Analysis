# Online Store Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This is a project that I created using a dataset based on an online superstore. Data analysis was used to determine if the amount of discounts given were hurting the company's profits.

## Technical skills used
- Excel
- Tableau

## Data Analysis Process
1. Define business problem to answer key questions for stakeholders
2. Clean data to be used for analysis
3. Import data into Tableau to be used for visualizations
4. Create dashboard and presentation for stakeholders and share insights
